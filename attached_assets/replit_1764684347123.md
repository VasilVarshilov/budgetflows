## Development Setup

### Running Locally
The project is configured to run on port 5000 with the Vite dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server is configured with:
- Host: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from Replit proxy)
- Port: 5000
- HMR over WSS on port 443

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Output directory: `dist/`

## Replit Configuration

### Workflow
- **Name**: Dev Server
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Port**: 5000
- **Output**: webview

### Deployment
- **Type**: Static
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Public Directory**: `dist`

## Path Aliases
The project uses TypeScript path aliases for cleaner imports:
- `@components/*` → `./components/*`
- `@utils/*` → `./utils/*`
- `@types` → `./types.ts`

## Recent Changes (December 2, 2025)
- Migrated from GitHub to Replit
- Updated Vite config for Replit environment (port 5000, HMR config)
- Removed GitHub Pages base path configuration
- Added TypeScript path alias mappings to tsconfig.json
- Configured static deployment with Vite build
- Set up Dev Server workflow

### UI/Logic Updates
- Removed "Електроенергия" section from Monthly Expenses tab
- Added new expense categories: "Вода" (Water) and "Ток" (Electricity)
- Changed ТОК tab button from "Запази за електромер 2" to "Добави към разходи"
- When clicking "Добави към разходи", creates two expense items:
  - "Сметка Ток - Електромер 1" with meter 1 calculated value
  - "Сметка Ток - Електромер 2" with meter 2 calculated value
- Electricity expenses are now saved as additional expenses in the same localStorage as other monthly expenses

## Data Persistence
All data is stored in browser localStorage:
- **HomeBudget_Data**: Monthly expense records
- **HomeBudget_GlobalSavings**: Global savings data

No backend or database is required for this application.

## Notes
- The application is entirely client-side
- All calculations happen in the browser
- Data is not synced across devices (localStorage is per-browser)
- The UI is in Bulgarian language
